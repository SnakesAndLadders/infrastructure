    # This hook is called once for every domain that needs to be
    # validated, including any alternative names you may have listed.
    #
    # Parameters:
    # - DOMAIN
    #   The domain name (CN or subject alternative name) being
    #   validated.
    # - TOKEN_FILENAME
    #   The name of the file containing the token to be served for HTTP
    #   validation. Should be served by your web server as
    #   /.well-known/acme-challenge/${TOKEN_FILENAME}.
    # - TOKEN_VALUE
    #   The token value that needs to be served for validation. For DNS
    #   validation, this is what you want to put in the _acme-challenge
    #   TXT record. For HTTP validation it is the value that is expected
    #   be found in the $TOKEN_FILENAME file.

    # Simple example: Use nsupdate with local named
    # printf 'server 127.0.0.1\nupdate add _acme-challenge.%s 300 IN TXT "%s"\nsend\n' "${DOMAIN}" "${TOKEN_VALUE}" | nsupdate -k /var/run/named/session.key

    # This hook is called after attempting to validate each domain,
    # whether or not validation was successful. Here you can delete
    # files or DNS records that are no longer needed.
    #
    # The parameters are the same as for deploy_challenge.

    # Simple example: Use nsupdate with local named
    # printf 'server 127.0.0.1\nupdate delete _acme-challenge.%s TXT "%s"\nsend\n' "${DOMAIN}" "${TOKEN_VALUE}" | nsupdate -k /var/run/named/session.key

    # This hook is called once for each certificate that has been
    # produced. Here you might, for instance, copy your new certificates
    # to service-specific locations and reload the service.
    #
    # Parameters:
    # - DOMAIN
    #   The primary domain name, i.e. the certificate common
    #   name (CN).
    # - KEYFILE
    #   The path of the file containing the private key.
    # - CERTFILE
    #   The path of the file containing the signed certificate.
    # - FULLCHAINFILE
    #   The path of the file containing the full certificate chain.
    # - CHAINFILE
    #   The path of the file containing the intermediate certificate(s).
    # - TIMESTAMP
    #   Timestamp when the specified certificate was created.

    # Simple example: Copy file to nginx config
    # cp "${KEYFILE}" "${FULLCHAINFILE}" /etc/nginx/ssl/; chown -R nginx: /etc/nginx/ssl
    # systemctl reload nginx
    #cp "${KEYFILE}" "${FULLCHAINFILE}" ./terraform/dev/pki/

    # This hook is called once for each certificate that is still

    #
    # Parameters:
    # - DOMAIN
    #   The primary domain name, i.e. the certificate common
    #   name (CN).
    # - KEYFILE
    #   The path of the file containing the private key.
    # - CERTFILE
    #   The path of the file containing the signed certificate.
    # - FULLCHAINFILE
    #   The path of the file containing the full certificate chain.
    # - CHAINFILE
    #   The path of the file containing the intermediate certificate(s).

    #
    # Parameters:
    # - DOMAIN
    #   The primary domain name, i.e. the certificate common
    #   name (CN).
    # - RESPONSE
    #   The response that the verification server returned

    # Simple example: Send mail to root
    # printf "Subject: Validation of ${DOMAIN} failed!\n\nOh noez!" | sendmail root

request_failure() {
    local STATUSCODE="${1}" REASON="${2}" REQTYPE="${3}" HEADERS="${4}"

    # This hook is called when an HTTP request fails (e.g., when the ACME
    # server is busy, returns an error, etc). It will be called upon any
    # response code that does not start with '2'. Useful to alert admins
    # about problems with requests.
    #
    # Parameters:
    # - STATUSCODE
    #   The HTML status code that originated the error.
    # - REASON
    #   The specified reason for the error.
    # - REQTYPE
    #   The kind of request that was made (GET, POST...)

    # Simple example: Send mail to root
    # printf "Subject: HTTP request failed failed!\n\nA http request failed with status ${STATUSCODE}!" | sendmail root

generate_csr() {

    # This hook is called before any certificate signing operation takes place.
    # It can be used to generate or fetch a certificate signing request with external
    # tools.
    # The output should be just the cerificate signing request formatted as PEM.
    #
    # Parameters:
    # - DOMAIN
    #   The primary domain as specified in domains.txt. This does not need to
    #   match with the domains in the CSR, it's basically just the directory name.
    # - CERTDIR
    #   Certificate output directory for this particular certificate. Can be used
    #   for storing additional files.
    # - ALTNAMES
    #   All domain names for the current certificate as specified in domains.txt.
    #   Again, this doesn't need to match with the CSR, it's just there for convenience.

    # Simple example: Look for pre-generated CSRs
    # if [ -e "${CERTDIR}/pre-generated.csr" ]; then
    #   cat "${CERTDIR}/pre-generated.csr"
